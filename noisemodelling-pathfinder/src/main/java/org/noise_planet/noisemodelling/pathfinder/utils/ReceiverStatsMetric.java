 * NoiseMap is a scientific computation plugin for OrbisGIS developed in order to

 * based on the French standard method NMPB2008. It includes traffic-to-noise
 * sources evaluation and sound propagation processing.

 * (http://www.ifsttar.fr/) as part of the Eval-PDU project, funded by the
 * French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) under contract ANR-08-VILL-0005-01.
