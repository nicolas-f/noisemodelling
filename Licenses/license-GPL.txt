NoiseModelling (formerly NoiseM@p or NoiseMap) is a scientific computation plugin for OrbisGIS developed in order to 
evaluate outdoor noise, mainly in urban areas. This model is
based on the French standard method for the road noise emission and the sound propagation (NMPB2008).
It includes traffic-to-noise sources evaluation and sound propagation processing.

This version is developed by the environmental Acoustics Laboratory (IFSTTAR) (http://www.lae.ifsttar.fr/)
and by the CNRS (initially IRSTV FR CNRS 2488 (2011-2014), now Lab-STICC â€“ CNRS UMR 6285 Equipe DECIDE Vannes (since 2014)).

This work was initially part of the Eval-PDU project, funded by the 
French National Research Agency (ANR) under contract ANR-08-VILL-0005-01.
