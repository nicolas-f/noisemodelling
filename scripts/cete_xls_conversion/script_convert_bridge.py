# NoiseMap is a scientific computation plugin for OrbisGIS developed in order to
# evaluate the noise impact on urban mobility plans. This model is
# based on the French standard method NMPB2008. It includes traffic-to-noise
# sources evaluation and sound propagation processing.
#
# This version is developed at French IRSTV Institute and at IFSTTAR
# (http://www.ifsttar.fr/) as part of the Eval-PDU project, funded by the
# French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) under contract ANR-08-VILL-0005-01.
